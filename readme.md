I've always enjoyed watching developers work. Which editor do they use? Do they prefer Terminal or iTerm? Are they using a virtual machine? If only in small pieces, I've learned from every developer I've ever worked with.

This repository contains automated setup scripts for my preferred tools and dev-based macOS defaults.

> **Warning:** If you want to give this setup a try, you should first fork this repository, review the code, and remove things you don’t want or need. Don’t blindly use my settings unless you know what they entail. *Use at your own risk!*

```sh
usage:
    SHELL_SCRIPTS_PATH="{where you cloned this repo}/scripts"		
    export PATH="$SHELL_SCRIPTS_PATH:$PATH"

available commands:
    setup           Run the installer and configure system
    update          Update packages and apps
    clean           Purge caches and prune repos
```
