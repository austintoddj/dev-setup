I've always enjoyed seeing other engineers' setups. Which editor do they use? Do they prefer Terminal or iTerm? Are they using a virtual machine? If only in small pieces, I've learned from every developer I've ever worked with.

This repo contains the installation of some basic tools, some handy aliases and functions. Backups of settings are done via [Mackup](https://github.com/lra/mackup).

You can install them by cloning the repository as `.dotfiles` in your home directory and running the bootstrap script.

```
git clone git@github.com:austintoddj/dotfiles.git .dotfiles
cd .dotfiles
./bootstrap
```

The bootstrap script can be run by cd-ing into the `.dotfiles` directory and performing this command:

```bash
./bootstrap
```
